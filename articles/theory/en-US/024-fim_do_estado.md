# Why is the state going to disappear?

On my first video, I briefly talked about why I believe the state is going to disappear on its own.
I said it was economically relevant during most part of history, bringing value to those that respected it.
It was really something necessary, but it's not any longer.
It only imposes costs to whom accepts it, and doesn't bring any benefit.
Every human creation ceases to exist at the time they become inefficient.
People tend to give a too much weight to what some people want.
"Government will continue existing because politicians and public agents want, they take advantage of this scheme."
But, in pratice, it's not that simple.
The moment something loses economic sense, extinction awaits it.
For the simple reason that those who ignore it have an economic advantage over those that still believe in the inefficient method.
