Who would build the roads?

It is inevitable. Every time I tell someone I'm an anarcho-capitalist, that I think governments are unnecessary,
the first question is: but who would build the roads? And I'm not talking about a socialist rage against libertarianism
but about a genuine curiosity concerning roads.

It's such a common reaction that even a meme came up in the USA, the "Muh roads!" meme:

"If taxation were theft, we wouldn't get benefits from it like courts, military, schools and of course muh roads!"
"If we don't steal money from people no one will fix muh roads"
"And then the state said: Let there be roads"

Let's break down the problem so that even a rooted statist can understand. The "who would build the roads" problem can
be split into three parts. First, who is going to choose where the road will be built. Second, convince the owner of
the estate to let that area be a public space. And third, the actual road construction (clearing, mounting, paving...)
and how to pay for it. Let's detail each part.

Who is going to choose where the road will be built?

The usual answer: nobody. The vast majority of roads came up spontaneously, without planning.
When a government "plans a road construction" it means choosing a path, improve it and transform it in a road.
But choosing a path between those that already exist it's something that people who live nearby can do.

But how paths appear? Some people that live in a place and need to go to another one begin to use a path.
The more people use the path, the more it becomes usable with less bushes and moss.
Then more people tend to use the path, a kind of positive feedback loop.

I live in Catete area at Rio de Janeiro. This area was originated around the Catete Street. Before the country capital,
Brasília, was built the brazilian government was settled in this street at the Palácio do Catete (Catete Palace).
Fortunately, nowadays the palace is just a dusty museum, with a blood stained pyjamas wore by brazilian former
dictator Getúlio Vargas when he shot himself.

Most people don't know but the Catete Street is older than Brazil. Indigenous tribes Tupinambás and Maracajás lived
in the area long before the arrival of the Portuguese. Catete was a swamp so no one lived there but was an important
path between indigenous villages. There were many indians those days so it was a large and well maintained path.

It was so well maintained that the Portuguese used the path themselves. Then, when the area was grounded, houses
were built around the Catete path so the construction of a street was obvious. That's how many roads and streets are
originated with the exception of planned cities.

So most roads and paths are spontaneous, originated by use. Obviously, there are planned ones. If someone has a large
land and sales plots he needs to decide where the roads will be so that people can buy the plots.

Now let's discuss our second part. You have verified that there is a demand for a new road connecting two cities.
How are you going to convince the owner to let the road pass that way?

This is pretty straightforward in anarcho-capitalism. Only voluntary agreements are acceptable. It may be a
partnership with the landowner or a transfer of rights of passage. But in no way wrong and unethical as the government
today that makes the road by expropriation, expelling people from the path. And if the landowner does not accept a
road on his property? Well, pass the road somewhere else or you won't build it. There is no other alternative.
Expropriation violates the non-aggresion principle (NAP).

At this point, a statist can raise the question of ownership within the estate. How can a person leaves its house
having to pass through another property? Actually, this is an old fallacy and has to do with the right to passage
that is part of the property right. Ownership is use, demarcation and defense. The interior house owner already used
his property when the exterior one was purchased. There was a path to the interior property. If the path was used and
marked the interior owner also owns that path. So the exterior owner can't build something there, unless another
acceptable path is provided.  If it happened otherwise and the exterior owner demarcated an internal property and sold
that lot to the interior owner, he must have build a path to the other's property. Who would buy a property without a
path to it?

The fact is that property must always be defined with the rights of passage. This is even recognized by current
statist legislation in Brazil and other countries.

Finally, the third point, who is going to asphalt the road and take care of its maintenance? Well, this point is the
easiest, because it already works today. Contractors build roads, not governments. And the contractors are already
private entities. But who will pay the contractors? There are several alternatives here.

It may be the residents of a region who voluntarily apply for paving and maintaining the road, it can be a
company that owns the toll road, whoever is going to use that road or that street. It could be companies
from the region who understand that they will have more profit with the paved and well-maintained street.

Many people do not know, for example, that the Las Vegas casino region is not part of the city of Las Vegas.
The region is actually called Paradise. It is an American non-incorporated region. There is nothing equivalent
in Brazil. Here in Brazil, we have the Union, the States and the Municipalities. Each charges different taxes. There
they have the Union, the States, the Counties and the Municipalities. Likewise, each of these charges its taxes.
So the whole Las Vegas Strip, that main street that has all the casinos, that even has that characteristic little sign,
it does not belong to the municipality of Las Vegas. As it does not belong to the municipality, it does not provide
policing, does not asphalt streets, does not take care of sewage and water. All of this is done by casino associations.
Guess what: it works much better than any city hall. Much cheaper even for casinos.

It is obvious when we think about. What would be more expensive? Paying for streets or hand money over politicians so
they pay for streets? In an anarcho-capitalist society, Ancapistan, people will pay for streets. If you don't live in
a business region, you may have to split the cost of maintaining your street with your neighbors. But this is going
to be a lot cheaper than paying the government to do that.
