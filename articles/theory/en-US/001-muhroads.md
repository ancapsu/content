# BUT… WHO’S GONNA BUILD THE ROADS, THEN?

It happens every time. Inevitably. Whenever I tell someone that I'm an anarcho-capitalist, that I think governments are unnecessary, the first question I get is: “but who’s gonna build the roads, then?” And I'm not referring here to the-run-of-the-mill socialist who bashes libertarianism. But rather to a genuine curiosity that people normally have.

This such a common reaction that we can see many "Muh roads!" memes all over the internet, such as…  
I’M OK WITH SLAVERY, THEFT AND MURDER BECAUSE… WHO WILL BUILD THE ROADS?  
PROOF THAT DEER HAVE FORMED A GOVERNMENT.  
AND THE STATE SAID: “LET THERE BE ROADS”.

Let's attempt to break down the problem so that it becomes crystal clear even for the most deeply rooted statist. The "who’s-gonna-build-the-roads" problem can be factored into three parts. And we have to address all three in order to have roads working properly. The first issue is who gets to decide where the road will be built. The second one is how that person (or committee) will convince the owner of the land to let it become a public space where the road will be built. And third comes the question of how is the actual construction of the road is done (earthwork, paving and maintenance) and, of course, how it’s paid for. Let's take a closer look at each of these points.

Who gets to decide where the road will be built?

The usual answer is: nobody. The vast majority of roads emerge spontaneously, without any planning. What the government calls “planning a road construction" is nothing but choosing an existing path, improving it and turning it into a road. But choosing a path among already existing ones is something that people who live nearby can do easily when they invest in a new road.

But how do such paths come to existence? I mean, those dirt roads. Well, some people living in a given place who need to go somewhere else begin to use a path. The more the people follow the path, the more the ground gets flattened and less weed grows there. Since it’s better to walk on a solid ground than on squishy earth, people then tend to use that path over and over again, leading to a kind of positive feedback loop. The more the people use the path, the more likely they are to do so next time.

I live in Catete, a neighbourhood in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This place originated around the Catete Street. It’s been forgotten for a long while, but it used to be quite an important street for the statists and nationalists. Before the current capital of Brazil was built far from here, the Federal Government was settled at Catete Street, in the ‘Catete Palace’. Fortunately, nowadays the palace is just a dusty museum that exhibits the blood stained pajamas wore by Brazilian former dictator Getúlio Vargas when he shot himself.

But the interesting thing most people don't know is that Catete Street is older than Brazil. The indigenous tribes Tupinambás and Maracajás lived in the area long before the Portuguese arrived. There were many villages in Rio de Janeiro, but not here in Catete. This area was a swamp, so no one could stay here. Even nowadays, whoever lives here knows it damn well, when it rains, Catete Street gets flooded. It’s always been like that. So, the natives didn’t nearby, but the place was an important path connecting villages. Back in the old days, there were many natives all around. So, the Catete path was wide and very well defined.

So much so that, when the Portuguese arrived, they too used the path. It was there already, and it was very functional, like those dirt roads we can find anywhere. One could easily drive horse carts there. No wonder why the Portuguese chose that particular path. We can even say it was not so much of a choice. The path imposed itself on them. Then, after the path was fully landscaped, houses were built along the way, defining the path even more, so that the construction of the street was obvious. That's precisely how 90% of the streets in Rio de Janeiro originated. Same thing anywhere in Brazil, granting the exception of cities fully planned top to bottom, such as our current capital: Brasília.

That’s it. Nobody plans anything. Paths emerge spontaneously as people pass by, often giving rise to roads eventually. Well, yes there are a few planned roads. Like… if you have a large land and intend to sell plots, you oughta decide where the roads will be, as no one will buy a plot if there’s no way of accessing it.

Now let's address the second issue. Suppose you’ve figured there is a demand for a new road connecting two cities; and you wanna provide that to the people. How are you gonna convince the land owner to let the road pass through it?

This is pretty straightforward in anarcho-capitalism, where only voluntary agreement is acceptable. You shall buy the land, or make a deal with the owner regarding the transfer of the rights of passage. In no way could you act unethically like governments currently do, making roads by first expropriating land, and expelling people from the places along the path. And what if the land owner doesn’t accept the construction of a road in his property? Well, you gotta have the road pass somewhere else around it, or you won't build it. There is no other alternative. Expropriation violates the non-aggression principle (or NAP).

At this point, your statist pal may raise the issue of a property within another property. How could you possibly leave your house if you have to pass through someone else’s property to do so? Actually, this is an old fallacy that has to do with the right to passage, which is part of the right to property. Let’s recall what property is. Ownership implies use, demarcation and defense. The point is: how did this situation start? There’s only one logical possibility after all. Before all that, you, the owner of the inner land have been already using a path that cuts through the outer land. That being the case, the path was defined previously to the  demarcation of the outer land. And, as the owner of the inner land, you shall reclaim property of that path, ‘cause, in fact, you own it as well. On the other hand, if you own the outer land, that path contained in it doesn’t belong exclusively to you. It’s shared property. You cannot build anything there, unless you provide another acceptable path. If the situation arose in a different way, such that the owner of the outer land demarcated the inner land in it and sold it to you, that person must have built a path to the inner property and granted you access to it. After all, who would buy a land without an access path to it?

Bottom line: right to property must always be defined alongside right to passage. This is acknowledged even by current statist legislation in Brazil and other countries, whose laws explicitly specify that.

Finally, we come to the third point: who’s gonna pave the road and take care of its maintenance? Well, this point is the easiest one, ‘cause the solution is already in place today. Construction companies build roads. Governments don’t. And those are private companies already. But who’s gonna pay them? Well, there are several alternatives.

Many people don’ know, for instance, that the area of Casinos is Las Vegas is not part of the city of Las Vegas. In fact, it’s a place called Paradise, which is a unincorporated town. There’s no equivalent to this in Brazil. Over here, we have the Union, the States and the Cities. Each one charges different taxes. In the United States, they have the Union, the States, the Counties and the Towns. Likewise, each of these charges its taxes. Thus, the whole Las Vegas Strip, that main avenue with all the Casinos and that famous sign… none of that belongs to the town of Las Vegas, which, therefore, does not provide for policing, street paving, water and sewage, and so on. All this is provided by Casino associations. Guess what: it works much better than any city hall. Much cheaper even for the casinos.

It could be the residents of a region who voluntarily gather for paving and maintaining the road. It could be a company that owns the road and covers the expenses by charging toll fees from whoever passes through it. It could a local company that realizes it will be more profitable for its business if the dirt road is paved and then kept in good shape.

It is obvious when we think about. What would be more expensive for the people? Paying for streets or handing money over politicians so that they pay for streets? In an anarcho-capitalist society — Ancapistan — people shall pay for streets directly. If you don't live in a business region, you may have to split the cost of maintaining your street with your neighbours. The good news is: this turns out to be a lot cheaper than paying the government to do that.
